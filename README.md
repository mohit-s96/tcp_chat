## TCP chatroom in nodejs

This is a tcp / sockket based chat room in nodejs. I was learning node so I made it because why not.
Currently supports multiple rooms and bot commands.

## Usage

Requires netcat / telnet clients.

Start server using

> node index.js

Open new terminals then:

Mac / Linux

> nc localhost 3000

OR

> telnet localhost 3000

Windows

> since microsoft telnet is shit, use putty or some netcat port
